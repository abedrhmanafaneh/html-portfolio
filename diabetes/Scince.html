        <h1>Introduction</h1>

       <p>Computer science students must be able to communicate because they will deal with programmers, computer engineers, managers, or other people who do not have sufficient experience in computer science. Therefore, they must have the skill to communicate the idea in its correct form, as the nature of the work requires dealing with a lot of Complex problems. It is also important to pay attention to the smallest details, because any defect or small mistake can lead to a problem. This is due to the sensitivity of the computer science discipline. Computer science students must always come up with new ideas to solve problems, and think within the framework of logic. Computer science students must have a good level in mathematics because it depends on mathematics in building equations and algorithms.</p>
       <p>If you do not have the basic skills in mathematics, analytical skills, problem-solving skills, office and routine work, and if you cannot keep up with technological development and updates; Computer science major is not suitable for you, since these matters are the main pillar of this major!</p>

       <h2>The ease and difficulty of majoring in computer science</h2>

       <p>There is no scale that determines the difficulty or ease of a major! However, there are some criteria that can be taken into consideration for each specialty separately. For example, the computer science major requires a lot of analytical skills, thinking, problem solving, organization, planning, and the ability to use computers for very long periods of time, in addition to effort, perseverance, and the practice of techniques that students learn daily.</p>

       <h3>Advantages of majoring in computer science</h3>

       <p>Computer science graduates gain many advantages, and the benefits are as follows:
