            <h1>Symptoms</h1>

            <p>Diabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar level is. Some people may not have symptoms, especially if they have prediabetes, gestational diabetes, or type 2 diabetes. In the case of type 1 diabetes, symptoms usually appear quickly and are more severe.

                Symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes:
                
                Feeling more thirsty than usual.
                frequent urination.
                Unintentional weight loss.
                Presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones are a by-product of the breakdown of muscle and fat that occurs when there is not enough insulin in the body.
                Feeling tired and weak.
                Easily irritable or other mood swings.
                blurry vision
                Slow healing of sores.
                Many infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections.</p>

                <h2>the reasons</h2>
                <p>To understand diabetes, it's important to understand how the body normally uses glucose.

                    How insulin works
                    Insulin is a hormone produced by a gland located behind and below the stomach (the pancreas).
                    
                    The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.
                    Insulin diffuses to allow sugar to enter the cells.
                    Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.
                    As the blood sugar level decreases, insulin secretion from the pancreas also decreases.</p>
